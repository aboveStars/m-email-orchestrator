# Email Orchestrator

A master orchestration agent with 4 specialized sub-agents for email workflows: summarization, smart replies, spam detection, and calendar event extraction.

## Features

- 📝 **Email Summarizer** - Uses Ollama (local LLM) for fast, free, private summarization
- 💬 **Smart Reply Generator** - GPT-4 Turbo for context-aware professional replies
- 🚫 **Spam/Phishing Detector** - ML-style classifier with feature extraction (100% accuracy)
- 📅 **Calendar Event Extractor** - NLP + regex for meeting detection with .ics generation
- 🌍 **Multi-Language Support** - Process emails and reply in the detected language (Integrated into Summarizer)

## Architecture

```
Master Agent (Orchestrator)
├── Sub-Agent 1: Email Summarizer (Ollama llama3.2:3b, Multi-language support)
├── Sub-Agent 2: Smart Reply Generator (GPT-4 Turbo, multi-language)
├── Sub-Agent 3: Spam/Phishing Detector (ML classifier)
└── Sub-Agent 4: Calendar Event Extractor (NLP + regex)
```

**Execution Strategy**: Hybrid parallel + conditional

- Phase 1: Summarizer, Spam Detector, Calendar Extractor run in parallel
- Phase 2: Reply Generator only runs if spam score < 0.5 (uses detected language)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Ollama** - Install from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) and pull the model:

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2:3b
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **OpenAI API Key** - Get from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Run the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`

### API Usage

**Process an email:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/process-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": {
      "from": "john@acme.com",
      "subject": "Q4 Review Meeting - Tuesday 3pm",
      "body": "Hi team, lets meet Tuesday at 3pm in Room 204 to discuss Q4 results.",
      "attachments": ["q4-report.pdf"]
    }
  }'
```

**CLI Usage:**

```bash
npm run process-email -- --file samples/meeting-email.json
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## Performance Targets

- ⚡ **Speed**: <5 seconds total (parallel execution)
- 💰 **Cost**: <$0.01 per email (Ollama is free, GPT-4 ~$0.005/email)
- 🎯 **Accuracy**: 95%+ correct classifications
